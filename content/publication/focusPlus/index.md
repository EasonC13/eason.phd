abstract: Distance teaching has become popular these years because of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, both students and teachers face several challenges in distance teaching, like being easy to distract. We proposed Focus+, a system designed to detect learners' status with the latest AI technology from their web camera to solve such challenges. By doing so, teachers can know students' status, and students can regulate their learning experience. In this research, we will discuss the expected model's design for training and evaluating the AI detection model of Focus+.
