title: Yuen-Hsien Tseng
subtitle: "Distinguished Professor at National Taiwan Normal University"
subtitle2: "May 22, 2022, Yuen-Hsien was Easonâ€™s undergraduate thesis advisor at NTNU"
summary: "Eason is the most clever and diligent student I have ever seen so far. He is enthusiastic about learning techniques and applications, such as Education, AI, NLP, and Blockchain, and has developed quite a few applications that impressed me.<br><br>

Moreover, He did not only develop application systems quickly but also evaluated their use in practical applications based on what he learned in his major, i.e., Learning Sciences.<br><br>

Lastly, He also devoted himself to scientific paper writing and therefore has several papers accepted in refereed international conferences. I have never heard of any undergraduate students in Taiwan who could have more than 7 papers accepted before their graduation, except Eason."
