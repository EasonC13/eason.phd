subtitle2: "May 20, 2022, George managed Eason directly at FiO"
summary: "Eason is a very talented, energetic, and self-disciplined person who gives 100% focus on things he is interested. During his work with me, he has demonstrated a great level of creativity with a great mentality for entrepreneurship. He is also a fast learner and loves discovering new technologies with strong desire for new and more knowledge. He possesses a huge potential to be explored and guided with a creative mind. He does have few areas to be further improved but I believe with right mind set, he will easily grow to the next level with no doubt."
