subtitle2: "June 25, 2022, Khánh worked with Eason on the same team at Cohart"
summary: "I have been working with Eason for a few months now. It was my job to integrate his work on Cohart's NFT minting smart contracts. I had no trouble reading and applying his works since they were well-documented and easy to understand. He has also been very supportive.<br><br>

Eason is always well-structured, fully-prepared, and excellent at presenting his work. I was also impressed with his calm and positive attitude when we encountered any issues.<br><br>

It was a pleasure to work with him and I highly recommend him to anyone who needs to research and develop blockchain, machine learning, or AI."
